XPath


What is XPAth in Selenium?
XPath locates your target element on the screen uniquely so that you can perform your
regular selenium actions such as click() senKeys() and etc

Absolute XPath:/html/body/div[1]/h1 --> Absoloute xpath starts from parent element HTML and very slow and lengthy. Not recommended. It starts with Single slash

Relative Xpath: starts with // and Very faster compared to Absolute and easy to write and use

//h1[.='Sign up to Speak Languages'] - to locate your element based on exact text match
//a[.='Privacy policy'] - to locate your element based on exact text match
//*[contains(text(),'language')] - Contains partial text given in complete webpage
//p[contains(text(),'language')] - Contains partial text inside a p tag inside webpage
(//p[contains(text(),'language')])[1] - if you want to locate index based element ...
//a - It gives all the matching elements of the given tag  a in complete webPage
//* - It gives all the available tags in complete webpage
//input[@id='first_name'] - Attribute and Value based xpath
//input[@name='first_name']- Attribute and Value based xpath
//a[.='Privacy policy']/following-sibling::a[2] - Sibling based Xpath
//a[.='Terms of use']/preceding-sibling::a - Sibling based Xpath
//h1[.='Phrase guides']/..//p --> Child to parent -->Child based Xpath
